<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I analyzed 542,000 online retail transactions from the UK to uncover revenue-driving products, identify at-risk customers, segment buyers, and predict future high-value customers. The goal is to provide actionable insights that guide marketing, improve retention, and accelerate business growth.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I explored the Ames Housing dataset, performed comprehensive EDA, handled missing values and outliers, engineered features, and ensembled Lasso, Ridge, LightGBM, and XGBoost models to predict house prices. My best model achieved RMSLE of 0.11983, ranking 139/4,256 participants (~Top 3.3%) on the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I trained predictive models using Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes) and Deep Learning (Backpropagation Neural Network) on geospatial datasets from Sentinel-2 imagery. The best-performing model, SVM, achieved 91.15% accuracy in 2022 and 83.90% in 2023 using three classes. I then analyzed spatial patterns and identified high-density non-vegetation (building) areas and potential growth zones within 3â€“5 km of UNRI.</div>
