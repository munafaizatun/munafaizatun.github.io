I compared SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, and BNN for land cover classification using Sentinel-2 imagery, with NIR and SWIR as key spectral bands. SVM achieved the highest accuracy with low variance. The analysis revealed significant non-vegetation concentration near major infrastructure, indicating urban development impact. Potential growth areas within 3-5 km of UNRI were identified, emphasizing the need for sustainable land-use policies (UU No. 26/2007).

<div style="text-align: justify">This project involves analyzing tweets related to the topic of "Vaksin" (vaccines) to determine the overall sentiment of public opinion. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, I collected a dataset of tweets and performed text pre-processing. The analysis classifies tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, offering valuable insights into public sentiment. This project aims to monitor public health discussions and trends surrounding vaccination on social media.</div>
