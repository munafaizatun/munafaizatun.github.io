<div style="text-align: justify">I explored the Ames Housing dataset, performed comprehensive EDA, handled missing values and outliers, engineered features, and ensembled Lasso, Ridge, LightGBM, and XGBoost models to predict house prices. My best model achieved RMSLE of 0.11983, ranking 139/4,256 participants (~Top 3.3%) on the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I analyzed customer churn for a utility company. By predicting churn, identifying key drivers, and simulating targeted 20% discounts, I demonstrated that selective interventions can increase profit without blanket price cuts. I also optimized a Random Forest model, showcasing skills in Python, machine learning, and data-driven business strategy.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I trained predictive models using Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes) and Deep Learning (Backpropagation Neural Network) on geospatial datasets from Sentinel-2 imagery. The best-performing model, SVM, achieved 91.15% accuracy in 2022 and 83.90% in 2023 using three classes. I then analyzed spatial patterns and identified high-density non-vegetation (building) areas and potential growth zones within 3â€“5 km of UNRI.</div>
