Classified land cover around Universitas Riau (UNRI) using Sentinel-2 imagery (10 m resolution) focusing on NIR & SWIR bands. Compared SVM, NB, and BNN, achieving highest accuracy with SVM (91.15% in 2022, 83.90% in 2023). Conducted spatial analysis, revealing non-vegetation concentration near major infrastructure and identifying potential growth zones 3â€“5 km from UNRI, supporting sustainable land-use planning.

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I will conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset related to strong wind disaster vulnerability in Sleman Regency. Following the analysis, I will apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to group areas based on factors such as disaster occurrences, fallen trees, and power network disruptions. The objective is to identify areas most vulnerable to strong wind disasters and provide actionable insights for disaster mitigation.</div>
