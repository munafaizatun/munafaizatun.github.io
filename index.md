<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I trained predictive models using Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes) and Deep Learning (Backpropagation Neural Network) on geospatial datasets from Sentinel-2 imagery. The best-performing model, SVM, achieved 91.15% accuracy in 2022 and 83.90% in 2023 using three classes. I then analyzed spatial patterns and identified high-density non-vegetation (building) areas and potential growth zones within 3â€“5 km of UNRI.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on strong wind disaster vulnerability data in Sleman Regency and applied K-Means clustering to group areas based on disaster occurrences, fallen trees, and power network disruptions. From my analysis, I identified high-risk areas and visualized them on a risk map, generating actionable insights to support disaster mitigation and planning.</div>
