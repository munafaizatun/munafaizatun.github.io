<div style="text-align: justify">I explored the Ames Housing dataset, performed comprehensive EDA, handled missing values and outliers, engineered features, and ensembled Lasso, Ridge, LightGBM, and XGBoost models to predict house prices. My best model achieved RMSLE of 0.11983, ranking 139/4,256 participants (~Top 3.3%) on the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I predicted customer churn for a utility company, identified key drivers of churn, and simulated targeted 20% discounts to improve retention. The analysis showed that selective discounting increased expected profit for high-risk churners without applying blanket price reductions.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I trained predictive models using Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes) and Deep Learning (Backpropagation Neural Network) on geospatial datasets from Sentinel-2 imagery. The best-performing model, SVM, achieved 91.15% accuracy in 2022 and 83.90% in 2023 using three classes. I then analyzed spatial patterns and identified high-density non-vegetation (building) areas and potential growth zones within 3â€“5 km of UNRI.</div>
