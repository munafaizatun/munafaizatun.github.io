<div style="text-align: justify">Conducted data analysis and predictive modeling on geospatial datasets using Sentinel-2 imagery, comparing SVM, NB, and BNN models, achieving 91.15% accuracy in 2022 and 83.90% in 2023 with minimal variance. Generated actionable insights from spatial patterns, identifying high-density building areas and potential growth zones within 3â€“5 km of UNRI.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I will conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset related to strong wind disaster vulnerability in Sleman Regency. Following the analysis, I will apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to group areas based on factors such as disaster occurrences, fallen trees, and power network disruptions. The objective is to identify areas most vulnerable to strong wind disasters and provide actionable insights for disaster mitigation.</div>
