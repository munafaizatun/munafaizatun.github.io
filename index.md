<div style="text-align: justify">I explored the Ames Housing dataset, conducted comprehensive EDA, handled missing values and outliers, engineered features, and ensembled Lasso, Ridge, LightGBM, and XGBoost models to predict house prices. My best model achieved an RMSLE of 0.11983, ranking 139/4,256 (~Top 3.3%) on the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>

### SmartChurn: Predicting & Explaining Customer Churn

<div style="text-align: justify">I predicted which customers were likely to leave and identified key drivers using XGBoost and SHAP. Scenario simulations showed that blanket discounts increased churn and reduced ROI, while targeted interventions for high-risk segments could improve revenue by ~10%. This demonstrates how data-driven strategies can boost retention without unnecessary price cuts.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I trained predictive models using Machine Learning (SVM, Naive Bayes) and Deep Learning (Backpropagation Neural Network) on geospatial datasets from Sentinel-2 imagery. The best-performing SVM model achieved 91.15% accuracy in 2022 and 83.90% in 2023 across three classes. I then analyzed spatial patterns to identify high-density non-vegetation (building) areas and potential growth zones within 3–5 km of UNRI.</div>
