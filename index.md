I compared SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, and BNN for land cover classification using Sentinel-2 imagery, with NIR and SWIR as key spectral bands. SVM achieved the highest accuracy with low variance. The analysis revealed significant non-vegetation concentration near major infrastructure, indicating urban development impact. Potential growth areas within 3-5 km of UNRI were identified, emphasizing the need for sustainable land-use policies (UU No. 26/2007).

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I will conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset related to strong wind disaster vulnerability in Sleman Regency. Following the analysis, I will apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to group areas based on factors such as disaster occurrences, fallen trees, and power network disruptions. The objective is to identify areas most vulnerable to strong wind disasters and provide actionable insights for disaster mitigation.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">This project involves analyzing tweets related to the topic of "Vaksin" (vaccines) to determine the overall sentiment of public opinion. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, I collected a dataset of tweets and performed text pre-processing. The analysis classifies tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, offering valuable insights into public sentiment. This project aims to monitor public health discussions and trends surrounding vaccination on social media.</div>
